<h2><a href="https://github.com/wlandau/workflowHelper">workflowHelper</a></h2>

<p>
This package is for anyone who uses <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to analyze multiple datasets in multiple ways.
With minimal code, you can smoothly can generate datasets, apply multiple methods of analysis to each dataset,
summarize each analysis of each dataset, collect the summaries, and generate presentable output.
And the best part is that <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/workflowHelper">workflowHelper</a> is
built on top of <a href="https://richfitz.github.io/">Rich Fitzjohn</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/richfitz/remake">remake</a>
package, so when you change your code, only the affected pieces of your workflow will
be recomputed when you run your workflow again. <a href="https://github.com/richfitz/remake">Remake</a>
is smart, so meaningful changes to code trigger rebuilds, but changes to comments and whitespace do not.
Deploy or update your workflow with a single call to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>,
and take advantage of the parallel computing available via <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake">parallelRemake</a>.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake">parallelRemake</a></h2>

<p>
This <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> package is a slight extension of
<a href="https://richfitz.github.io/">Rich Fitzjohn</a>'s
<a href="https://github.com/richfitz/remake">remake</a>. <a href="https://github.com/richfitz/remake">Remake</a>
does not support parallel computing natively, so I wrote <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake">parallelRemake</a>
in order to generate a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Makefile</a> that distributes
<a href="https://github.com/richfitz/remake">remake</a> rules over simultaneous processes.
<a href="https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake">ParallelRemake</a> is also a building block of
<a href="https://github.com/wlandau/workflowHelper">workflowHelper</a>.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/wlandau/fbseq">fbseq</a></h2>

<p>
This <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> package toolkit is at the center of my dissertation research.
It fits a hierarchical model to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq">RNA-sequencing</a>
data and other high-dimensional count data
in fully Bayesian fashion via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> (MCMC). I
accelerated the MCMC using massively parallel, the machinery for which
is encapsulated in separate helper packages. The <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/fbseqCUDA/">fbseqCUDA</a>
package implements <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda">GPU-accelerated</a> MCMC with tens of thousands of simultaneous threads,
and the <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/fbseqOpenMP/">fbseqOpenMP</a> implements
the same parallelism on a smaller scale using <a href="http://openmp.org">OpenMP</a>.
Publication of the method is pending.
