<h2><a href="https://github.com/wlandau/fbseq">fbseq</a></h2>

<p>
This <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> package toolkit is at the center of my dissertation research.
It fits a hierarchical model to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq">RNA-sequencing</a>
data and other high-dimensional count data
in fully Bayesian fashion via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> (MCMC). I
accelerated the MCMC using massively parallel, the machinery for which
is encapsulated in separate helper packages. The <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/fbseqCUDA/">fbseqCUDA</a>
package implements <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda">GPU-accelerated</a> MCMC with tens of thousands of simultaneous threads,
and the <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/fbseqOpenMP/">fbseqOpenMP</a> implements
the same parallelism on a smaller scale using <a href="http://openmp.org">OpenMP</a>.
The publication of the method is pending.

<p>
This package is for anyone who uses <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to analyze multiple datasets in multiple ways,
and it has been a huge help for my own reproducible workflows.  For the full story and motivation, check
out the <a href="http://will-landau.com/2016/06/14/workflow.html">blog post</a>.

<p>
This <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> package implements parallel computing for
<a href="https://richfitz.github.io/">Rich Fitzjohn</a>'s
<a href="https://github.com/richfitz/remake">remake</a> package. For the full story and motivation, check
