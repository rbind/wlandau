<h2>Dynamic Ledger</h2>

<p>Personal accounting can be frustrating when there are a lot delayed 
transactions. With pending charges and charges that take some time 
to even reach the bank, it can be hard to know how much you 
actually have left. That's why I created 
<a href="https://github.com/wlandau/dynamic-ledger">Dynamic Ledger</a>.
Unlike most other accounting programs, it gives you control over your 
finances even when you have several delayed transactions. With it, you 
can be exactly as frugal as you need to be, and you can easily avoid 
spending more than you actually have.
</p>

<p>The program accepts a tab-delimited ledger file like the one below as input.

<code><pre>

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td width="100">amount</td>
<td width="100">status</td>
<td width="100">credit</td>
<td width="100">bank</td>
<td width="100">partition</td>
<td width="100">description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100">-30.14</td>
<td width="100">cn</td>
<td width="100">card</td>
<td width="100">checking</td>
<td width="100">gas</td>
<td width="100">gas</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100">-15.36</td>
<td width="100">cp</td>
<td width="100">card</td>
<td width="100">checking</td>
<td width="100">food</td>
<td width="100">food</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100">-5</td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100">card</td>
<td width="100">checking</td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100">400</td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100">checking</td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100">300</td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100">checking</td>
<td width="100">food</td>
<td width="100">food fund</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100">200</td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100">checking</td>
<td width="100">gas</td>
<td width="100">gas fund</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100">440</td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100">checking</td>
<td width="100"></td>
<td width="100"></td>

</table>

This is not my personal ledger, of course, but it is a useful example.
If the file above is called <code>ledger.txt</code>, then I can open Terminal 
(or another command line interface program) and type 

<code><pre>
dl ledger.txt
</pre></code>

And I get a summary of my ledger.

<img align="middle" src="{{page.root}}img/dynamic-ledger.png" height="650px" width="650px"/>

The summary tells me that I have $0.00 "available" on my credit card and $1,335.00 
"available" in my credit card. These are the balances that I should see on my banks' 
websites and <a href="http://www.mint.com/">mint.com</a> if I've done my bookkeeping
correctly. But in reality, I owe my credit card company $45.50 and I only have 
$1,289.50 of <i>real</i> money in my bank account because of the two delayed 
transactions at the top of the ledger file.

<p>Currently, the program is an open source Linux/Unix-style package written in C. You can 
clone it from <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/dynamic-ledger">my GitHub page</a>
or download the source as a tarball from 
<a href="https://github.com/wlandau/dynamic-ledger/blob/master/dl-0.0.tar.gz?raw=true">here</a>.
It should be compatible with all platforms with a C compiler. Installation and usage
instructions are explained in the <code>man</code> page and pdf tutorial.</p>


<p>I've done my personal accounting this way for years, and it's given me
a lot of peace of mind. It's gratifying to be able to finally package
up this system and distribute it as a program that other people can use.</p>

<p>Eventually, I want to turn Dynamic Ledger into an app for Mac,
iphone, and Android. I've written most of the backend already. The plan
is to learn Objective C and Cocoa and then write a spreadsheet program
that not only computes summaries, but also allows the user to 
condense and clean ledgers (supported in the current version), click
and drag around rows and columns, etc. Please let me know what 
you'd like to see.</p>
