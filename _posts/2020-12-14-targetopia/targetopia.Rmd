The [`targets`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets) R package is a [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)-like pipeline toolkit for reproducible data science. It tackles copious workflows and demanding runtimes to accelerate research papers, simulation studies, and other computationally intense projects in fields such as Bayesian statistics and machine learning. [Relative to its predecessor](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/articles/need.html), [`drake`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake), [`targets`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets) is not only more efficient, but also more extensible. The modular interface and object-oriented design allow package developers to write reusable target factories.^[In early 2020, my colleague [Richard Payne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-d-payne-2b3b0b3b) wrote a package to support a specialized [`drake`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake) plan factory, an idea that I previously underestimated. His package helped users create pipelines of their own, but it struggled against the constraints of [`drake_plan()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/reference/drake_plan.html), which is a major reason I decided to design [`targets`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets) with target factories in mind.] If you want to help other data scientists create a certain specialized kind of pipeline, you can write a function that creates a list of target objects.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# yourExamplePackage/R/example_target_factory.R
target_factory <- function(data) {
  list(
    tar_target_raw("file", data, format = "file"),
    tar_target_raw("simple_model", quote(run_simple(file))),
    tar_target_raw("flexible_model", quote(run_flexible(file))),
    tar_target_raw("conclusions", quote(summarize(simple_model, flexible_model)))
  )
}
```

Then, when users of your package write [`_targets.R`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/walkthrough.html#file-structure), the pipeline becomes much easier to express.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# _targets.R
library(targets)
library(yourExamplePackage)
tar_pipeline(target_factory("dataset.csv"))
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(targets)
tar_script({
  target_factory <- function(data) {
    list(
      tar_target_raw("file", data, format = "file"),
      tar_target_raw("simple_model", quote(run_simple(file))),
      tar_target_raw("flexible_model", quote(run_flexible(file))),
      tar_target_raw("conclusions", quote(summarize(simple_model, flexible_model)))
    )
  }
  tar_pipeline(target_factory("dataset.csv"))
})
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
tar_visnetwork(targets_only = TRUE)
```


With pre-packaged target factories, end users do not need to write as much code, and they do not need to be familiar with the advanced features of [`targets`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets). 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("targetopia.png")
```

The [R Targetopia](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia.html) is the Pandora's Box of low-hanging fruit that dangles from target factories, and its goal is to democratize reproducible pipelines across more of the R community. It is a growing ecosystem of R packages that abstract away the most difficult parts in [`targets`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets) and make workflows simple and quick to write.

At the time of writing, the newest [R Targetopia](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia.html) package is [`stantargets`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets), a domain-specific workflow framework for Bayesian data analysis with Stan. With [`stantargets`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets), writing a complex [simulation study](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/articles/mcmc_rep.html) is as simple as a one call to [`tar_stan_mcmc_rep_summary()`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/reference/tar_stan_mcmc_rep_summary.html). [This complicated pipeline](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-stan/blob/main/_targets.R) condenses down to the simple one below. Not only is the code shorter, but advanced concepts like [file tracking](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/files.html), [dynamic branching](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/dynamic.html), and [batching](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/dynamic.html#batching) are completely abstracted far away from the user. Bayesian statisticians can spend less time on software development and more time on model development.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# _targets.R
library(targets)
library(stantargets)
stan_targets <- tar_stan_mcmc_rep_summary(
  model,
  "model.stan",
  generate_stan_data(), # custom function
  batches = 40, # Batching reduces overhead.
  reps = 25, # reps per batch
  variables = c("beta", "true_beta_value"),
  summaries = list(
    ~posterior::quantile2(.x, probs = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975))
  )
)
tar_pipeline(stan_targets)
```

[`tarchetypes`](https://wlandau.github.io/tarchetypes) is a more general [R Targetopia](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia.html) package that simplifies general-purpose tasks such as [static branching](https://wlandau.github.io/tarchetypes/reference/tar_map.html) and [parameterized R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html%23parameter_types%2F). As [described here](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/files.html#multiple-parameter-sets), it is straightforward to reproducibly render a [parameterized R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html%23parameter_types%2F) report repeatedly across a large grid of parameters.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# _targets.R
library(targets)
library(tarchetypes)
library(tibble)
tar_pipeline(
  tar_target(x, "value_of_x"),
  tar_render_rep(
    report,
    "report.Rmd",
    params = generate_large_param_grid(), # custom function
    batches = 50 # Batching reduces overhead.
  )
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("question.png")
```

If you like developing [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/), please consider contributing an R Targetopia package for your own field of data science. I do plan to post detailed guidance in early 2021. But for now, the main piece is a [target factory](https://wlandau.github.io/posts/2020-12-14-targetopia/) that calls  [`tar_target_raw()`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/reference/tar_target_raw.html). Functions [`substitute()`](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html#substitute), [`tar_sub()`](https://wlandau.github.io/tarchetypes/reference/tar_sub.html), and [`tar_eval()`](https://wlandau.github.io/tarchetypes/reference/tar_eval.html) can help create [language objects](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html#capturing-expressions) for the `command` argument of [`tar_target_raw()`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/reference/tar_target_raw.html). Functions [`tar_manifest()`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/reference/tar_manifest.html), [`tar_network()`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/reference/tar_network.html), [`tar_dir()`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/reference/tar_dir.html), and [`tar_test()`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/reference/tar_test.html) help write [examples](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html?q=examples#man-workflow) and [tests](https://testthat.r-lib.org/). Feel free to borrow the source code of [`tarchetypes`](https://github.com/wlandau/tarchetypes) or [`stantargets`](https://github.com/wlandau/stantargets), and do not hesitate to reach out.
