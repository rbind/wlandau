The R package <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake">drake</a> (data frames in R for Make) is a workflow manager and build system. It reproducibly tracks your code, output, and dependencies so that when you make a change, only the necessary steps are re-executed to bring your results up to date. Multiple modes of parallel computing are supported: single-session parallelism with <code>parallel::mclapply()</code>, multi-session parallelism with <a href="http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/">Makefiles</a>, and true distributed computing on clusters and supercomputers. 

I owe a lot to the efforts of others. Most importantly, the <a href="https://github.com/richfitz/remake">remake</a> package by <a href="http://richfitz.github.io/">Rich FitzJohn</a> paved the way for an R-focused reproducible build system. In a sense, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake">drake</a> is just my way of digesting the original ideas that <a href="https://github.com/richfitz/remake">remake</a> pioneered. In addition, <a href="http://krlmlr.github.io/">Kirill M&uuml;ller</a> and <a href="http://danielfalster.com/">Daniel Falster</a> made pivotal contributions to <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake">parallelRemake</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator">remakeGenerator</a>, which I subsumed into <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake">drake</a>.

You can install <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake">drake</a> from <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake">CRAN</a> or <a href="https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake">GitHub</a>. The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake/vignettes/drake.html">overview</a> and <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake/vignettes/quickstart.html">quickstart</a> vignettes are step-by-step guides to get you started. You can submit bug reports, questions, and feature requests to the <a href="https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/issues">issues page</a>, and you can contribute to development through <a href="https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake">GitHub</a>.

Be prepared to think differently about how you <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/hilaryparker/opinionated-analysis-development">develop your analysis</a>.
