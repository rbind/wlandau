The new <code>wildcard</code> package (
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wildcard">CRAN</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/wlandau/wildcard">GitHub</a>
) is a templating mechanism for data frames in R. Wildcards are placeholders for text, and you can evaluate them to generate new data frames from templates. I first conceived of the idea for the <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator">predecessor</a> of <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake">drake</a>, and I decided that the generative templating mechanism deserved to be a package of its own. Personally, I find it much more flexible and convenient than `expand.grid()`.

The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wildcard/vignettes/wildcard.html">tutorial vignette on CRAN</a> demonstrates the full functionality, and I have included a taste below.



<pre><code>library(wildcard)
myths <- data.frame(myth = c("Bigfoot", "UFO", "Loch Ness Monster"), 
                    claim = c("various", "day", "day"), 
                    note = c("various", "pictures", "reported day"))
wildcard(myths, wildcard = "day", values = c("today", "yesterday"))
</code></pre>

<pre style = "background: transparent"><code style = "background: transparent">##                myth     claim               note
## 1           Bigfoot   various            various
## 2               UFO     today           pictures
## 3               UFO yesterday           pictures
## 4 Loch Ness Monster     today     reported today
## 5 Loch Ness Monster yesterday reported yesterday
</code></pre>

<pre><code>wildcard(myths, wildcard = "day", values = c("today", "yesterday"), expand = FALSE)
</code></pre>

<pre style = "background: transparent"><code style = "background: transparent">##                myth     claim           note
## 1           Bigfoot   various        various
## 2               UFO     today       pictures
## 3 Loch Ness Monster yesterday reported today
</code></pre>
