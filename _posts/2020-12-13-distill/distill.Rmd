[Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) just announced the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) release of [`distill`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), an R package for formatting scientific and technical websites. Like all [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) tools, [`distill`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) is super easy to use. It took only a few minutes to convert [my old portfolio](https://wlandau.github.io/portfolio2020) into a nicer-looking [personal website](https://wlandau.github.io/).

The release of [`distill`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) is timely. After a challenging 2020, it is nice to have a little nudge to refresh and regroup for 2021.

For me personally, this is the right time to rebuild my website. It has been four years since I started my career, and I now have a better understanding of how I fit into my professional community.
