title: "The downsize package is on CRAN!"
---

<p>
I introduced the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=downsize"><code>downsize</code></a> package in my <a href="http://wlandau.github.io/2016/06/14/workflow/">post on reproducible workflows</a>, and I am excited about its <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=downsize">CRAN release</a>.
</p>

<p>
If your workflow takes a long time to run, you want to test it quickly, and <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/unit-testing-with-r/">unit testing</a> is too reductionist to cover everything, the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/downsize/"><code>downsize</code></a> package can help. Just intersperse your code with calls to the `downsize()` function. Then, you can toggle the test and production versions of your workflow with the flip of a <code>TRUE/FALSE</code> global option. That way, you avoid tedium and human error, and your test is a close approximation to the task at hand.

<p>
The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=downsize/vignettes/downsize.html">package vignette</a> has a full tutorial. In addition, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=downsize/">downsize</a> is compatible with <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator">remakeGenerator</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator/blob/master/vignettes/remakeGenerator.Rmd">remakeGenerator vignette</a> suggests one of many ways to use these packages together.
