title: "The downsize package is on CRAN!"
---

<p>
I first introduced the <a href="http://wlandau.github.io/downsize"><code>downsize</code></a> package in my <a href="http://wlandau.github.io/2016/06/14/workflow/">post on reproducible workflows</a>, and I am excited about its <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=downsize">official release to CRAN</a>.
</p>

<p>
If your workflow takes a long time to run, you want to test it quickly, and <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/unit-testing-with-r/">unit testing</a> is too reductionist to cover everything, the <a href="http://wlandau.github.io/downsize"><code>downsize</code></a> package can help. Just intersperse your code with calls to the <code>downsize()</code> function. Then, you can toggle the test and production versions of your workflow with the flip of a <code>TRUE/FALSE</code> global option. That way, you avoid tedium and human error, and your test is a close approximation to the original task at hand.

<p>
The <a href="http://wlandau.github.io/downsize/articles/downsize.html">online package vignette</a> has a full tutorial. In addition, <a href="http://wlandau.github.io/downsize">downsize</a> is compatible with <a href="http://wlandau.github.io/remakeGenerator">remakeGenerator</a>, and the <a href="http://wlandau.github.io/remakeGenerator/articles/remakeGenerator">remakeGenerator vignette</a> explains how to use these packages together.

<h2>Edit: updates in version 0.2.0</h2>

The main change is that I deprecated functions <code>scale_up()</code>, <code>scale_down()</code>, and <code>scaling()</code> in favor of <code>production_mode()</code>, <code>test_mode()</code>, and <code>my_mode()</code>. Because I explain <code>downsize</code> to people in terms of test and production modes, it seemed only natural to have this choice of words built into the package. The minor changes are the addition of a <code>help_downsize()</code> function to suggest helpful links and updates to the documentation.
