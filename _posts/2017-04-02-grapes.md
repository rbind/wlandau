In some computing subcultures, the term "grapes" refers to the percent sign, which R uses to name binary operators such as <code>%*%</code>. The <code>grapes</code> package in R makes them out of arbitrary functions. As with the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html">magrittr pipe</a>, this could help you avoid cumbersome parentheses in your code.

<pre><code>library(grapes)
grow(rbind, c, from = "base") # Use `from` to specify a package or environment to search.
bunch() # see the operators (grapes you have grown)
nrow(sleep) # 20
longer = sleep %rbind% sleep %rbind% sleep # No clumsy parentheses!
nrow(longer) # 60. Most of us would like to sleep longer.
1 %rbind% 2 %c% 3
</code></pre>

The <code>grapes</code> package is <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=grapes">on CRAN</a>, and the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=grapes/vignettes/grapes.html">tutorial vignette</a> is posted there. Feel free to follow updates <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/grapes">on GitHub</a> and submit bug reports, feature requests, etc. to the <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/grapes/issues">issue tracker</a>.
