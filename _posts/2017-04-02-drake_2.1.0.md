Just last week, I released <code>drake</code> version 2.1.0 to <a href="https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake">CRAN</a>! This is a minor update: important, but fully back-compatible with the last release (2.0.0). There are three major changes:

<ol>
  <li>
A new parallel computing option: <code>parallel::parLapply()</code>, now default on Windows. From now on, Windows users can enjoy the same single-R-session parallelism already afforded to non-Windows users via <code>parallel::mclapply()</code>. On non-Windows systems, <code>mclapply()</code> remains the default mode of parallelism because of its lower overhead and back-compatibility with version 2.0.0.
  </li>
  <li>
The <code>tracked()</code> function. It is possible to trick <code>drake</code> into missing dependencies in strange edge cases, so be sure to use <code>tracked()</code> to list all the targets and imports that are reproducibly tracked in your project. To see the complete dependency map, see the functions <code>build_graph()</code>, <code>plot_graph()</code>, and <code>read_graph</code> (already in <code>drake</code> version 2.0.0).
  </li>
  <li>
The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=drake/vignettes/caution.html">"caution" vignette</a> (latest version <a href="https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/blob/master/vignettes/caution.Rmd">on GitHub</a>). There are several ways to trick drake into failing or making incorrect decisions, so I decided to compile and explain some of the most likely pitfalls in a vignette.
  </li>
</ol>
