<p> I am a Statistics PhD candidate at Iowa State University. 
My research interests include statistical computing and 
statistical genomics. I received my Bachelor of Science 
in Mathematics from the University of Chicago in 2011.
I do martial arts in my spare time, and I sail and 
climb whenever I have the chance. </p>
