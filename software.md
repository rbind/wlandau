- [drake](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/) Save time, stay reproducible, and scale up. Featured in the [rOpenSci blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/02/06/drake/) and [R Podcast Episode 22](https://r-podcast.org/episode/022-diving-in-to-drake-with-will-landau/).
- [downsize](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=downsize) Ease the transition between testing and deploying data analysis workflows.

## Support for [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)

- [remakeGenerator](https://www.github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator) Generate large [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)-style workflows.
- [parallelRemake](https://www.github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake) Parallel computing support for [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake).

## Utilities

- [eply](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eply) Like `apply()`, but for processing batches of quoted expressions.
- [grapes](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=grapes) Turn functions into binary operators.
- [wildcard](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wildcard) Generate data frames from templates.

## Dissertation research

- [fbseq]({{ "/fbseq" | prepend: site.github }}) Fully-Bayesian GPU-accelerated analysis of RNA-seq data ([arXiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06659)).
