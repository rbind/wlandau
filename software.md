title:  Reproducible workflow toolkit
---

- [drake](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake) A scalable solution for reproducibility and high-performance computing.
- [downsize](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=downsize) Ease the transition between testing and deployment.

## Support for [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)

- [remakeGenerator](https://www.github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator) Generate large [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)-style workflows.
- [parallelRemake](https://www.github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake) Parallel computing support for [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake).

## Utilities

- [grapes](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=grapes) Turn functions into binary operators.
- [eply](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eply) Like `apply()`, but for processing batches of quoted expressions.
