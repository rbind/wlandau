I am a statistician and software developer working in the life sciences industry.
I like to solve scientific problems and build software tools for data analysis, including the <a href="https://ropensci.github.io/drake/">drake R package</a>.
I am also a minimalist, a sailor (wind-powered, not military), a climber, and a martial artist.
