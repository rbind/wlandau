I am a research scientist in the life sciences industry.
I like to solve scientific problems from a statistician's perspective,
and I like to build software tools for data analysis, including <a href="https://wlandau-lilly.github.io/drake/">the <code>drake</code> R package</a>.
I am also a minimalist, a sailor (wind-powered, not military),
a climber, and a martial artist.
