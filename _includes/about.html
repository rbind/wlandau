I am a new Statistics PhD, and I will begin my career at
<a href="https://www.lilly.com/home.aspx">Eli Lilly and Company</a> on October 10, 2016.
I like to solve scientific problems from a statistician's perspective, and I like to build tools for data analysis.
I am also a minimalist, a sailor (wind-powered, not military), a climber, a CrossFitter, and a martial artist.
