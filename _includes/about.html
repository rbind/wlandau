I am a new Statistics PhD seeking opportunities in the biomedical and technology industries.
I like to solve scientific problems from a statistician's perspective, and I like to build tools for data analysis. 
I am also a minimalist, a sailor (wind-powered, not military), a climber, a CrossFitter, and a martial artist.
