    "contents": "\nRstudio just announced the CRAN release of distill, an R package for formatting scientific and technical websites. Like all RStudio tools, distill is super easy to use. It took only a few minutes to convert my old portfolio into a nicer-looking personal website.\nThe release of distill is timely. After a challenging 2020, it is nice to have a little nudge to refresh and regroup for 2021.\nFor me personally, this is the right time to rebuild my website. It has been four years since I started my career, and I now have a better understanding of how I fit into my professional community.\n\n\n\n",
