    "contents": "\nRstudio just announced distill, and R package for formatting scientific and technical websites. Like all RStudio tools, distill is super easy to use. It took only a few minutes to convert my old portfolio into a nicer-looking personal website.\nThe release of distill is timely. After a challenging 2020, many of us are looking for little ways to refresh and regroup as we gear up for 2021.\nFor me personally, the time is right to rebuild my website. It has been four years since I started my career, and I now have a better understanding of how I fit into my professional community. I have archived my old portfolio and blog posts, and I plan to start anew.\n\n\n\n",
