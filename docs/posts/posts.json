It took only a few minutes to convert my old portfolio into a nicer-looking personal website.\nThe release of distill is timely. After a challenging 2020, it is nice to have a little nudge to refresh and regroup for 2021.\nFor me personally, the time is right to rebuild my website. It has been four years since I started my career, and I now have a better understanding of how I fit into my professional community. I have archived my old portfolio and blog posts, and I plan to start anew.\n\n\n\n",
