The targetopia is an ecosystem of R packages for democratized reproducible pipelines at scale. [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)-like pipelines accelerate development and reduce frustration for research papers, simulation studies, and other data science projects with copious workflows and demanding runtimes. As [this post](https://wlandau.github.io/posts/2020-12-14-targetopia/) explains, the goal of the targetopia is to make powerful pipelines accessible and friendly.<br><br>

[![](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active) [`targets`](https://wlandau.github.io/targets) is the core engine of the targetopia. It learns the components of your data analysis project, runs the work with distributed computing, and skips steps that are already up to date. It reduces the runtime of successive runs, and it shows tangible evidence that your results match the underlying code and data.<br><br>

[`tarchetypes`](https://wlandau.github.io/tarchetypes) makes it easy to add certain kinds of common tasks to reproducible pipelines. Most of its [functions](https://wlandau.github.io/tarchetypes/reference/index.html) create families of targets for [parameterized R Markdown](https://wlandau.github.io/tarchetypes/reference/tar_render_rep.html), [simulation studies](https://wlandau.github.io/tarchetypes/reference/tar_rep.html), and other general-purpose scenarios.<br><br>

[`stantargets`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets) is a workflow framework for Bayesian data analysis with [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/). With concise, easy-to-use syntax, it defines versatile families of targets tailored to Bayesian statistics, from a [single MCMC run with postprocessing](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/articles/mcmc.html) to [large simulation studies](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/articles/mcmc_rep.html).

`jagstargets` is just beginning development and is not yet publicly available. When implemented, it will do for [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/) what [`stantargets`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets) does for [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/).

An implementation is planned, but no work has started. The goal is to accommodate [`brms`](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms)-powered Bayesian data analysis workflows just as [`stantargets`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets) enhances [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/).

[![](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept) `tarmarkdown` is an idea first proposed [here](https://github.com/wlandau/tarchetypes/issues/23#issuecomment-748329846). An implementation has not started, and no formal commitment has been made. The goal is to accommodate dependency-aware literate programming workflows, where computationally intense targets build upstream and inexpensive R Markdown reports render downstream. Functions in [`tarchetypes`](https://github.com/wlandau/tarchetypes) already achieve this to a limited degree, but there is not currently functionality to handle more complicated use cases such as [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org) books, [R Markdown sites](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-13.html), or [`workflowr`](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/) projects.

<br>
Following precedent of [`stantargets`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets), it should be possible to create a targetopia package tailored to each of the most popular methodology packages whose users face intense computation, long runtimes, and rapid changes. Possibilities include [`greta`](https://greta-stats.org), [`nimble`](https://r-nimble.org), [`keras`](https://keras.rstudio.com), [`torch`](https://torch.mlverse.org), [`torchvision`](https://github.com/mlverse/torchvision), [`tidymodels`](https://github.com/tidymodels/tidymodels), and [`nlmixr`](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr).
